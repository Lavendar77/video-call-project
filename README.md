# Video Call Project
This is a simple project for Video Calling via the web. Using Agora.io

> Agora.io seems to allow you to manually create a channel (with a temporary token (24hours limit)), which limits my use to create multiple channels at will by users.
> So for now, any channel a user creates will still be the same on Agora, which means that all users will join the same video call ðŸ¤¢ Hence, create one channel and share with another device.
> Will do some more research though.

## Scope
- User creates a channel.
- Other users may see a list of all channels.
- Each channel lasts only 1 hour.
- The owner of a channel may lock a channel if they do not need others to join.

### Technical Notes
- When a user intends to join a channel, the system;
  - Double-checks to ensure the channel has not ended. If it has ended, the component notifies the user and then refreshes the list.
  - Checks to ensure the channel is not locked.
- Only the owner of a channel can close it.
- A channel is only active for 1 hour, after which it closes automatically.
